description = "For Maloca's 9th installment, Le Motel returns to his own imprint and joins forces with UK's versatile pidgin rap experimentalist Magugu. After their 2021 Shoalin collaboration, these 2 prolific artists embark on a new musical voyage. Their upcoming 4-track EP “Kindness Weakness” carefully intersects Bass, UK Garage, Grime and Jungle.   \n  \nMagugu is a Nigerian poet who fluently unifies Afrobeat, Dancehall with Grime and Drum and Bass. While performing Magugu raps in Pidgin, which is an English-based creole language spoken in Nigeria. For more than a decade he's been making a name for himself as a Cardiff-based artist with a distinguishable raw voice. After numerous releases on his own imprint GUGUGANG Records, the Pidgin Rap Guru also released on cutting-edge labels like Deep Medi Musik and Critical Music and has worked with significant artists like My Nu Leng, Phase and Chad Dubz.   \n  \nOn Topper is a Jungle/Baile anthem about reaching goals in life, regardless of who steps in your way. Blend is about being an individual that doesn’t fit in with the crowd. Everyone should make their own decisions. Kindness Weakness refers to the fact that some people view kindness as a weakness. Yet everybody has had their share of dark moments too. The final track portrays the softer side of the duo's artistic versatility. A laid back UK Garage groove accompanied by Magugu's soothing voice. Let me down represents finding inner peace and creating your own happiness because in life there are too many people who will let you down. This one goes out to making a promise to yourself and never giving up.   \n  \nLaunched in 2020, Maloca Records aims to bring together an international network of artists. Maloca Vol. 1, featuring tracks by Nick León, OMAAR, DJ JM, Dengue Dengue Dengue, Coen, DJ N.K. and Tsongo. Maloca has also released solo EP's from Howie Lee, Farsight, Griffit Vigo, DJ JM and Yuto Takei.\n\n### credits\n\nVocals by Magugu   \nMusic by Le Motel   \nMixed and mastered by Jean Vanesse @ greenHouse Studio   \nBass on « Let me down » by Victor Defoort   \nArtwork by Le Motel Typography by Lucas Descroix"
