description = "Coen, the elusive artist behind 2017’s highly acclaimed ‘Yellah’, returns with an 8 track mini album on Le Motel’s Maloca Records. Created over the last two years during the artist’s relocation from Manchester (U.K.) to London, the collection is a DJ’s gift box, built around stripped back, hard hitting beats at a range of different moods and tempos.\n\nMuch of the music uses the artist’s own percussion collection, meticulously recorded and sampled for use on this record. From Tama’s 166bpm four-on-the-floor assault, to the wild drum solos of Pressure Roll and the Miami bass-tinged LFNT - take your pick. Or, for the real club heads, sit back and take a trip through the twists and turns of the full release."
